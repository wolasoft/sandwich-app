# Sandwich Club Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## What i did ?
- JSON data is parsed correctly to a Sandwich object in JsonUtils
- JSON is parsed without using 3rd party libraries
- DetailActivity shows all Sandwich details correctly
- Detail layout includes a ScrollView so all the details are visible in small screen devices
- Sandwich details are shown in a sensible layout. For example, ingredients appear next to the ingredients label
